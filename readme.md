GPflowR (jee-pee-flower) is an R port of the [GPflow python package](github.com/gpflow/gpflow#README.md) for fitting Gaussian process models using tensorflow.
The aim is to make this a pretty close translation of the python code, so the package uses [R6 classes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/vignettes/Introduction.html) for object-oriented design, with some tweaks and hacks to mimic python behaviour and functionality.

The package is currently only in the very early stages of development, so watch this space!
