Description: A port of the GPflow python package to R. gpflowr implements
    Gaussian process models using Google's TensorFlow library (via the tensorflow
    R package). This enables automatic gradient construction via symbolic
    differentiation, efficient linear algebra, and portability to CPUs, GPUs, and
    across platforms. Like tensorflow, this package requires installation of python
    and TensorFlow.
